# Portfolio content

## Overview

- Start thinking about what work you want on your website. **You should have 7–10 of your absolute best pieces—you’re aiming for less pieces for higher quality.**
- Create a list of the pieces you want to include, even if they’re not done yet.
- Write a small descriptions for each piece denoting this information:
  - Title of the work;
  - Type of work (print, motion, web, etc.);
  - Why you’re including it—and how it shows your talent.
- Try to find sketches, older versions, etc. for each piece—**the best portfolios use case studies to show work, not just still images.**

## Goal

The goal is to show off what you’re capable of doing as a graphic designer. The more focused your portfolio pieces the better.

*Think about your perfect company & perfect job and only include work that will help you get that job!* The more focused the better. If you want a job at Shopify, as an example, target your portfolio to exactly what Shopify is looking for.

**Remain honest—if you have absolutely no interest in coding, don’t show coded websites.**

### Case studies are best

The absolute best portfolio websites include case studies for every showcased work. **Case studies are what employers are looking for.**

Employers want to see:

- the purpose & goal of the project;
- your different ideas;
- your process;
- the steps you took to get to the final version;
- feedback and thoughts for the different stages;
- and maybe the final version—but it’s less important.

(As a by-product, you also can prove that you are capable of writing—an extremely important trait for a designer.)
